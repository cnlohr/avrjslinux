JSLinux Running on an AVR with I/O Port Remapping

This project is based off of avrcraft:
https://github.com/cnlohr/avrcraft

It was taken from commit e7c676f39c (Feb 15, 10:02 PM EST)

It also uses jslinux from Fabrice Bellard.  I took a copy from

http://bellard.org/jslinux/

Back in 2011, and have been modding that.  I asked his permission
and got this back:

"You can publish your work provided you put a clear credit and
link to my JSLinux page on your page."  - Fabrice Bellard (11/28/2011)


I may write a more comprehensive how-to...
